                    <p>It was back in 6th grade when I first got introduced to the world of programming. Now, looking
                        back after <strong>6-7 years</strong>, it feels like a lifetime of discovery. From those early
                        days of curiosity to where I am now, my journey has been a rollercoaster of syntax errors,
                        "aha!" moments, and a profound shift in how I view technology.</p>

                    <p>Over the years, I've dabbled in a multitude of languages: <mark>Java, Python, JS, Bash, Ruby, and
                            Rust</mark>. Each brought its own flavor and philosophy, but looking back, I realize I fell
                        into a common trap that many beginners face.</p>

                    <h2>The "Syntax Trap"</h2>

                    <p>I was learning languages fast. Too fast. I would jump from one language to another, mastering the
                        basic syntax, learning a few functions, and then feeling like I had "learned" the language. But
                        I was missing the point.</p>

                    <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1515879218367-8466d910aaa4?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1350&q=80"
                        alt="Code on screen" style="width:100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1em 0;">

                    <p><em>Programming languages are not just about syntax.</em> It's easy to think that knowing how to
                        reverse an array in Rust means you know Rust. But that's just <strong>control</strong>. Real
                        mastery is having <strong>command</strong> over the language, knowing how to build something
                        tangible, something useful.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        "Knowing how to reverse an array but not being able to build something using that language is a
                        waste of DSA and potential."
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>I spent a lot of time on DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms). Don't get me wrong, DSA is
                        important, but <mark>practical implementation is where the real magic happens</mark>. Investing
                        too much time in abstract problems without building real-world projects can leave you feeling
                        stuck in the terminal, unable to affect the world outside it.</p>

                    <h2>Entering the Realm of Libraries</h2>

                    <p>The turning point for me was realizing that we need to stop at the syntax and basic functions and
                        enter the realm of <strong>libraries</strong>. These are the superpowers. They are what allow
                        you to move outside the terminal and interact with the real world, building web servers,
                        automating tasks, creating games, and analyzing data.</p>

                    <p>Once I embraced libraries and frameworks, I felt a massive unlock in my potential. I wasn't just
                        solving puzzles anymore; I was creating solutions.</p>

                    <h2>Why I Love Programming</h2>

                    <p>Programming has fundamentally changed how I look at problems. It's taught me patience, logic, and
                        the art of breaking down complex issues into manageable chunks. And yes, while I made the
                        mistake of jumping between languages too quickly in the past, today I feel that diverse exposure
                        has made me a better engineer.</p>

                    <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1498050108023-c5249f4df085?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1350&q=80"
                        alt="Laptop usage" style="width:100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1em 0;">

                    <p>I feel confident now. I feel skilled enough to know that I won't be easily replaced by an
                        AI-governed environment. AI is a tool, but the creativity, the architectural thinking, and the
                        human insight we bring to code is irreplaceable.</p>

                    <h2>Advice for Fellow Programmers</h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Don't just learn syntax.</strong> Build things. Break things. Fix things.</li>
                        <li><strong>Master one language</strong> deeply before jumping to the next.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use libraries.</strong> They are your best friends.</li>
                        <li><strong>Balance DSA with Development.</strong> You need both to be a complete engineer.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Thank you for reading my story. Keep coding, keep building!</p>
